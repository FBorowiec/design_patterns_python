# **Facade pattern**

## **Intent**

Exposing several components through a single interface.

Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface (API) over a large and sophisticated body of code.

## **Motivation**

- Balancing complexity and presentation/usability
- Typical code has:
    - Many subsystems
    - Complex internal structure
    - End user should not be exposed to interals
